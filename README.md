## Overview

![screenshot](https://res.cloudinary.com/dvjnagd3i/image/upload/v1623880814/yicfy7yl5h6zddqhvlsz.png)

This is an app solution for a challenge in <a href="https://devchallenges.io/challenges/N1fvBjQfhlkctmwj1tnw">devchallenges</a> website

It was fun to embrace the challenge and endure the struggle of the unkown.
I gotta admit a felt awesome while completing the user' stories from the requirements list

I've learned a lot in the process of coming up with a solution, here's an sample:
  - building forms in react app with formik
  - validate form's before submition
  - Context api
  - Protecting routes
  - Dark theme
  - Creating customs hooks

- My wisdom? Well! Never be afraid of challenges, embrace the struggle and keep going

Your can view a running demo app <a href="https://authentication-app-lype.vercel.app">here</a>
